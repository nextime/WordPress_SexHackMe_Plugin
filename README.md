# SexHackMe Wordpress Plugin

This plugin is developed for the website https://www.sexhack.me

The most updated version of this plugin and the developement is 
at https://git.nexlab.net/SexHackMe/sexhackme

The goal is to have a platform for Video streaming on demand
somewhat similar to pornhub based on wordpress + woocommerce.

The plugin is in a very early developement stage therefore 
continuosly evolving and possibly still very bugged, so 
please contact me if you like to use it at franco@nexlab.it

plugin dependencies aren't really fully managed (yet), 
this is a list of the actual dependencies:

 * WooCommerce (core dependency)
 * Paid Members Subscriptions (core dependency)
 * Unlock Protocol (only if enabled in the general options)
 * Ultimate Members (optional)

 It is also assumed you are using storefront as a theme in couple with 
 WooCommerce, but should work with other themes too.

 For more details please take a look to the [TODO LIST](https://git.nexlab.net/SexHackMe/sexhackme/blob/master/TODO.txt)


## The Project idea behind Sexhack.me

 Tired of the limitations imposed to which content is ok and what's not on 
 onlyfans, pornhub and similar mainstream porn web sites I started a project 
 to let performers post those videos that would not be accepted for
 publication on the mainstreams ones because of the content 
 (like impact play or medical play videos etc) 
 or because not well supported (like 3D/VR videos), 
 as well as any other porn video, and that likes to publish 
 them for free to watch or selling them online.
 
 The project will be completely comunitary, 
 there is no company or for profit organization behind, 
 just me, my partner, some friends and whoever would like to join, 
 and the property of the project itself will be distributed 
 with a DAO logic ( Distrubuted Autonomous Organizations ), 
 other than supporting all the cool things of today's web 
 like cryptocurrencies, NFTs both for distributions 
 of the shares from advertising and managing 
 content property, accessibility over TOR other than normal web, 
 fully open source code, etc etc.
 
 The functional logic will be somewhat similar to pornhub, 
 you have a model profile, you can upload videos and 
 choose if they are public, members only or to be sold.

 The web site still in early developement stage, 
 at the moment only few content from me and my partner 
 are online, but soon will be possible to open a model account.

 The web site will also have a strong educative connotation 
 with a section dedicated to educational content 
 on body and sex positivity, inclusivity, consent, 
 bdsm/fetish/kinks and so on, so, educational content 
 both in video and as articles are also welcome, 
 with or without nudity.
