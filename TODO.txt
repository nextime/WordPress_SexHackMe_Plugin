This is a very rough plan for this plugin
based on the ideas i planned for www.sexhack.me:


 - Version 0.0.2:
   * Proper functioning Video post type page for Videos, use WC products only for downloads.

 - Version 0.0.3:
   * Integration of Ultimate Members plugin for user and model profiles

 - Version 0.0.4:
   * Upload Videos page for models

 - Version 0.1.0:
   * Fixes of all the features on the previous versions
   * More projection on 3D/VR videos Support 

 - Version 0.2.0: 
   * User wallets?
   * Model wallets and payments system

 - Version 0.3.0:
   * Remove dependency on Paid Member Subscription plugin, reimplement membership internally

Future developement:
   * Write new smartcontract for automation of instant and scheduled payout to models
   * Write new NFTs login system, remove Unlock Protocol dependency
   * More social features
   * Scalability: explore/support object storage support, distributed web support
   * Scalability: better caching support
   * Scalability: reduce DB/Storage queries with better use of sessions
   * Web site performances: move content to ajax calls for lower data exchange and less requests
   * Considering to remove Woocommerce and create internal system for payments and downloads
   * IPFS Support for data storage?
   * General cleanup for privacy

SPARSE NOTES 

It's just a quick dirty list of things i want to 
remember to do, mostly little refinery.

---------------------------------------


 * Look at exporters/importers of user data: https://rudrastyh.com/wordpress/personal-data-exporters-and-erasers.html
 * reduce duplication of code, database queries.
