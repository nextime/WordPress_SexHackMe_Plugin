This is NOT a proper TODO list.

It's just a quick dirty list of things i want to 
remember to do, mostly little refinery.

---------------------------------------


 * Look at exporters/importers of user data: https://rudrastyh.com/wordpress/personal-data-exporters-and-erasers.html
 * reduce duplication of code, database queries.

-------------------------------------

SOON this plugin will be re-written to make some order and re-group
action, filters and so on with a better organizations of classes, hooks etc,
and then the initialization will be re-done from scratch removing the "sub plugin selection"
while we will remove dependencies from woocommerce, pms and the rest.
